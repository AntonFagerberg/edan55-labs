Labs for EDAN55
===============

A set of exploratory assignments designed for the course EDAN55
"Advanced Algorithms" at Lund University.

Every lab has its own directory and contains two subdirectories:

  <labname>/data     -- data files
  <labname>/doc      -- lab documentation (LaTeX)

Installation
------------

To make the documentation, you need an up-to-date (2012) version of
LaTeX. Then

    cd <labname>/doc
    make
